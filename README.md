# js-coe-experiments

Modus Create is investing a lot of energy in JavaScript. We're working to learn more about this ecosystem to help the community and our clients to build better web applications and Node APIs.

This repository holds examples of different practices using JavaScript ecosystem. We are constatly publishing content in our Blog and Youtube Channel about the experiments we've built here.

If you are a Modus Create employee and you want to contribute, feel free to join our #coe-js channel and start a discussion there.
