# Engineering Experiments

This repository holds examples of different practices and patterns. Most (but not all) of them use the JavaScript ecosystem, where we have invested a lot of energy. We are working to learn more about pratices and patterns to help the community and our clients to build better applications and APIs. 

We are constatly publishing content on our [Blog](https://moduscreate.com/blog) and [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/moduscreate) about the experiments we have built here.

If you are a Modus Create employee and you want to contribute, feel free to join our `#engineering` Slack channel and start a discussion there.
