# Server to Server Communication with gRPC
The goal of this project is to demonstrate how 3 services can communicate with each other using gRPC. The services will be for an event ticketing system â€” Events, Invoices, Tickets. The project has been set up such that the directory `boilerplate-code` contains the base code that can be used in completing the experiment. It uses only a HTTP server and has no implementation of gRPC. The `experiments` folder is where all the fun is. It is build off the boilerplate code and it contains the gRPC implementation.
